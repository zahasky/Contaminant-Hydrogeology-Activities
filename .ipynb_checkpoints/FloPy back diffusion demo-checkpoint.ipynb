    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook we will introduce a 2D numerical model with a (simple) heterogeneous conductivity field. This will allow us to illustrate a common mechanism called back diffusion that creates a major challenge in field scale remediation. This process occures when soluble contaminates, often things like dissolved non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs), diffuse into low conductivity zones as the plume is migrating through the aquifer. After the main plume has passed, these contaminants continue to diffuse back into the high conductivity zone leading to long-term release. This creates challenging and expensive long-term remediation and monitoring cases. This model is based on the tank experiments in [Chapman et al, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169772212000599?via%3Dihub).\n",
