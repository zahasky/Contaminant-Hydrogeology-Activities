    "## Introduction\n",
    "We have now been introduced to both analytical and numerical modeling techniques for solving the advection-dispersion equation for different initial and boundary conditions. As a reminder, the analytical solutions are **exact**, closed form expressions as a function of space and time. Numerical solutions are **approximate** solutions of concentration at discrete locations in space and time. The goal of this notebook is to better understand how to use the numerical methods that we have relied on in MODFLOW/MT3D so that our approximate numerical solutions are as close as possible to the exact analytical solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our advection package we define the variable ```mixelm```. This variable defines the numerical solution techniques that we use in our model. You may have noticed in playing around with some of the models and comparing them with the analytical solutions that the numerical result can diverge from the expected output. Many times this has to do with the numerical model not utilize the optimal/correct solution technique for the given problem. The focus of this notebook is to better understand some of these options and limiations.\n",

    "The next cell illustrates the relevant lines of code where we define the solution method in MT3D. This is copied directly from our [FloPy 1D Function Notebook](https://github.com/zahasky/Contaminant-Hydrogeology-Activities/blob/master/FloPy%201D%20Function.ipynb)."

    "## Standard finite difference with upstream weighting or central-in-space weighting (mixelm = 0)\n",
    "The standard finite difference method is probably the one that we are most familiar with as it is widely used for solving differential equations. In our ADE the advection term is discretized via:\n",
    "\n",
    "$v \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} = v \\frac{C_{j+1/2} - C_{j-1/2}}{\\delta x}$\n",

    "$D \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2} = D \\frac{C_{j+1} - 2C_j + C_{j-1}}{(\\delta x)^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is good because it conserves mass and is computationally efficient for disperion dominated problems. The disadvantages are that it suffers from numerical dispersion effors for advection dominated problems and may experience artificial oscillation. To minimize the numerical dispersion we sometimes need very fine discretization. Specifically we want the Peclet number to be less than 3, where the characteristic length scale in the Peclet number is the grid cell size.\n",
