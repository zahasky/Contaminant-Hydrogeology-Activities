    "To complete the modeling activities in this class you will need to download and install the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Install Python (3.7 or 3.8)](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). I strongly encourage using the Anaconda distribution if Python. Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of Python for scientific computing that aims to simplify package management and deployment. When installing Python, make sure to install the latest version. From the Anaconda Distribution page, you should see a download button that has choosen the correct distribution for your operating system (OS). Follow the instructions to download this distribution. When it is complete you will see a folder of new programs including Spyder, Anaconda Powershell Prompt, and Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a new virtual environment. Setting up a virtual environment creates an environment on top of an existing Python installation, known as the virtual environment’s “base” Python. These environments are isolated so only those explicitly installed in the virtual environment are available. This ensures that all of the notebooks for this course will run on your system without conflicts with other packages currently installed. If you have the anaconda installation of Python then I suggest using [conda for creating and installing packages in this environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html). To set up a virtual environment name ```hydroclass``` go to your Command Prompt/Terminal or Anaconda Powershell Prompt and copy and paste ```conda create -n hydroclass python=3.9``` and press enter. To activate this environment type ```conda activate hydroclass```. Once activated you should see (hydroclass) before your terminal path. **Important Note: You need to run this activation command every time you open Python to ensure that you are always operating in this environment.**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Set up the virtual environment.  Now you just need to install all of the packages that we will use for this class. The easiest way to do this is to navigate to the folder where you have this repository saved using the ```cd``` command in the terminal. Once you think you are in the correct folder type ```dir``` in the terminal to verify that you see the class notebooks and most importantly that you see a text file titled `requirements.txt`. You then can type `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all of the packages at once.\n",
    "4. Open up the notebook editor. In this class, you can use either Jupyter Notebooks or Juptyer Labs to complete the in-class activities and homework. Jupyter Lab is preferred due to the ease of setup, navigation, and more compact browser use (it only opens one tab). If Python and the `requirements.txt` packages have been installed correctly you should now be able to open Jupyter Lab by typing ```jupyter lab``` in any terminal and Jupyter Lab should open in your default internet browser window. Once open, navigate to where you have downloaded and saved this notebook and open it in Jupyter Lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "To verify that you have correctly installed Python let's run a simple test command. To execute the following cell click on it with your mouse and hit then hit the 'play' button (triangle) in the panel above. Alternatively, you could use the shortcut 'shift + enter'."
