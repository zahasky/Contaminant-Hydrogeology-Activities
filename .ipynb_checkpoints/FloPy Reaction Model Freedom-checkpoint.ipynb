    "Now that we have seen the combined power of analytical and numerical model to solve solute transport problems with solutes experiencing zero order, first order, sorption, and kinetic reactions, use these tools to model a process we have not yet explored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pair up and first program an analytical solution that we have not yet used and then build a corresponding 1D or 2D FloPy model to cross validate your models. Start by thinking about a scenario that you would like to understand better and then discuss how you would go about using these models to quantitatively describe transport in this scenario. \n",
    "Here are a few ideas:\n",
    "- Build a first draft of your final project model,\n",
    "- Replicate a model in one of the papers that we have read, \n",
    "- Or something else!\n",

    "A good place to look for analytical solutions is the compilation by [van Genuchten and Alves, 1982](https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/download/CAT82780278/PDF), however many additional analytical solutions have been developed since then.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin here are a few useful blocks of code that we typically start with, feel free to look through past notebooks (for example the analytica solution used in the [First Order Reactions notebook](https://github.com/zahasky/Contaminant-Hydrogeology-Activities/blob/master/First%20Order%20Reactions.ipynb) for additional codes/functions to get started."
