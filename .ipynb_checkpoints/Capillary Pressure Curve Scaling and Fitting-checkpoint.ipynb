This method is often also refered to as mercury injection capillary pressure measurements (MICP or MIP). This aparatus uses air and mercury as the working fluids (more information on the theory is available [here](https://www.micromeritics.com/Repository/Files/Mercury_Porosemitry_Theory_poster_.pdf)). In this unique case gas is the wetting phase and mercury is the nonwetting phase. The data were collected on a Berea sandstone.

To apply these measurements to different fluid pairs, for example a NAPL and water, it is necessary to scale the capillary pressure data. As described in the course notes, the equation to scale capillary pressure is $Pc_{scaled} = Pc_{measured} \\frac{\\sigma_{scaled} \\text{cos}\\theta_{scaled}}{\\sigma_{measured} \\text{cos}\\theta_{measured}}$. Here the subscript 'scaled' refers to the fluid pairs we want to calculate for and the subscript 'measured' applies to the fluid pairs used for the capillary pressure measurement.\n",

Assume the contact angle of air-water is 10 degrees ($\\theta_{scaled}$), the contact angle of air-mercury is 140 degrees ($\\theta_{measured}$). The interfacial tension of air-water is 72 mN/m ($\\sigma_{scaled}$), the interfacial tension of air-mercury is 485 mN/m ($\\sigma_{measured}$)."
