    "As constructed, it is assumed that the mobile and immobile domain sorption and first-order reactions are identical. However these can be different and just requires editing the package input line (`flopy.mf6.ModflowGwtist`) in the model below. Therefore, the only additional input that is required is to specify the porosity and volume fraction of the immobile domain and the mass transfer term.\n",
