    "When the advection-diffusion equation (ADE) is linear, sums of the solutions are also linear. This important condition allows us to use the \\textit{principle of superposition} to analytically solve the ADE and the diffusion equation for relative complex (i.e. mixed or inhomogeneous) boundary conditions. As described by Bear (1972) \"The principle of superposition means that the presence of one boundary condition does not affect the response produced by the presence of other boundary or initial conditions. Therefore, to analyze the combined effect of a number of boundary conditions (excitations) we may start by solving for the effect of each individual excitation and then combine the results.\" For example, the principle of superposition is often used to analytically describe the transport behavior of finite volume solute plumes. If $C_{1D}$ is the one dimensional analytical solution to the diffusion equation with a constant source $C(x=0,t) = C_0$, then a plume with initial concentration $C_0$ and width $\\delta x$ can be described by:"
