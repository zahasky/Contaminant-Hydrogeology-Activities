    "To apply superposition we need a few conditions to be true. First, we need a “linear” differential equation. That is, one for which: a) the dependent variable and all its derivatives are of the first degree (i.e. the power on any dependent variable terms is one) b) the coefficients are constants or functions of only the independent variable(s) The second condition is that we the differential equation needs to be homogeneous. A linear differential equation is mathematically homogeneous if the term(s) without the dependent variable equal zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the advection-diffusion equation (ADE) is linear and homogeneous, sums of the solutions are also linear. This important condition allows us to use the principle of superposition to analytically solve the ADE and the diffusion equation for relative complex (i.e. mixed or inhomogeneous) boundary and initial conditions. As described by Bear (1972) \"The principle of superposition means that the presence of one boundary condition does not affect the response produced by the presence of other boundary or initial conditions. Therefore, to analyze the combined effect of a number of boundary conditions (excitations) we may start by solving for the effect of each individual excitation and then combine the results.\" For example, the principle of superposition is often used to analytically describe the transport behavior of finite pulse of solute.\n",

Negative numbers in the 'erfc' and 'sqrt' function are what lead to the warning above. To make our function more robust we can either use the 'real' numpy function to our time variable inside the 'erfc' functions. Or we can record the location of negative values of t (see 'indices_below_zero'), set t at these locations equal to some arbitrary positive number, and then make sure to set the corresponding concentrations equal to zero."
