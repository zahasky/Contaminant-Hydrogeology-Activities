Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of Python for scientific computing that aims to simplify package management and deployment. When installing Python, make sure to install version 3.7.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a PC then:\n",
    "2. [Download](https://www.usgs.gov/software/modflow-2005-usgs-three-dimensional-finite-difference-ground-water-model) and install MODFLOW (Version 2005) and associated packages. Note that this is NOT the latest version (the most recent version is MODFLOW 6). We will use the 2005 version because it is still supported by the USGS and has a longer track record and more example problems for FloPy integration. Additionally, you will need to [download MT3D-USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/software/mt3d-usgs-groundwater-solute-transport-simulator-modflow), the solute transport package for MODFLOW.\n",
