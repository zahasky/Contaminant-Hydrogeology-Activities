Start by thinking about a scenario that you would like to understand better and then discuss how you would go about using these models to quantitatively describe transport in this scenario. This model could explore some of the capabilities of the MODFLOW Reaction package that we have not yet explored. Or you could look at how heterogeneity of various transport or reaction parameters impacts observed transport behavior at an observation location. Or something else!\n",
