    "## Introduction\n",
    "Analytical solutions are a powerful method to understand basic mechanisms of transport in the subsurface. However, modeling transport in more complex systems requires the use of numerical models. FloPy is a Python library that allows us to utilize the widely used USGS MODFLOW simulation programs. MODFLOW is the same modeling program you were introduced to in GEOSCI/GEOENG 627, except in this class we will use FloPy to run and process the results rather than a GUI. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why use FloPy?\n",
    "* It's free!\n",
    "* It is powerful. For example, Flopy can generate input files for the MODFLOW family programs in a few lines of code!\n",
    "* It is flexible. You can solve an incredible array of problems by creating custom models, performing iterative modeling approaches or sensitivity analysis, and you can easily integrate data analysis workflows. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the MODFLOW programs you worked with in the past, we will also be using the associated MT3D groundwater solute transport simulator for MODFLOW that supports simulation of transport using the MODFLOW flow solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Make sure you have everything installed \n",
    "Prior to completing this notebook you need to have FloPy installed. Instructions can be [found here](https://github.com/zahasky/Contaminant-Hydrogeology-Activities/blob/master/MODFLOW%2C%20Python%2C%20and%20FloPy%20Setup.ipynb).\n",
